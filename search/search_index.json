In the options for \u201cRTCM Corrections\u201d the user can choose the delivery method for corrections to the R1a. The options are: * USB RF Modem like Holybro 915MHz * NTRIP Client * TCP Server the R1a connects to * TCP Client connecting to the R1a\u2019s pre-defined port Click \u201cSave\u201d to save the changes. The R1a will immediately start trying to connect to the selected channel. * If \u201cTCP Listen\u201d is selected, the R1a will always listen on the port, and once a client connects to the port, the R1a will accept the connection. * If \u201cUSB RF Modem\u201d is selected, the R1a will automatically detect connection of a compatible USB RF Modem and open the serial link. * If \u201cNTRIP Client\u201d or \u201cTCP Connect\u201d is selected, the R1a will keep trying to connect to the specified address until it succeeds. Once a connection is established, the R1a will start sending its position in a NMEA0183 $GPGGA message, so a virtual reference station can be generated. Real base stations ignore those messages. Once the R1a receives RTCMv3 corrections, it will use them to compute RTK position. It will also record the RTCMv3 messages it has received while recording data, so they can be used for post-processing as well.

Attach the R1a to your vehicle \u00b6 The R1a can be attached to any number of vehicles in order to acquire LiDAR data. In this quickstart we will assume you are attaching the LiDAR to a drone. If you are attaching to another vehicle please refer to our Community for additional help. Refer to the setup guide for your particular drone to connect the R1a. DJI Matrice 300 RTK DJI Matrice 210 DJI Matrice 600 Power on and Connecting to the R1a \u00b6 First, ensure the supplied usb drive is inserted into the R1a. Then, power on the R1a. After powering up the unit, open Wi-Fi settings on your host computer (tablet, smartphone, or PC) and look for the wireless network labeled: RESEPI-###### Connect to this network using the following password: LidarAndINS Next, open up the web browser of your choice and go to the following web address: 192.168.12.1 Configure the R1a \u00b6 In order to obtain as accurate as possible LiDAR data from the R1a, the unit needs to be configured for the data acquisition vehicle. This includes the \"IMU to Antenna Offset\" and the \"Vehicle to IMU Rotation\". If using one of the provided setup kits, the information will be provided for you. If you are using another acquisition vehicle refer to the Community for additional help. Setup your Base Station \u00b6 A highly accurate trajectory is necessary for accurate results from the R1a. In order to obtain this accurate trajectory you must use a GNSS base station. We recommend the Emlid Reach RS2 . Follow the RS2 documentation for setting up your base station. The base station should be configured to log Raw data in RINEX 3.03+ format for the entire duration of the R1a data acquisition. Calibrate the R1a \u00b6 After turning on the R1a be sure to let the R1a sit in a static position for at least 5 seconds. Before turning on the LiDAR, you will need to fly a figure 8 pattern three times to ensure the IMU is calibrated. Once calibration is complete, land the drone. Collect Data \u00b6 When you are ready to start collecting data click the 'Start' button within the web interface. The LiDAR, IMU, and GPS will all start collecting data. Proceed with your planned mission! Note: To protect the user from accidently attempting to record data while the USB is unattached, the user does not have the ability to \u201cStart\u201d data recording in the \u201cStatus\u201d window when the USB is unattached. When unattached the user will see the message shown below in Fig. 2-8. Message displayed when trying to record data while USB is unattached. At the completion of the mission you will need to fly three additional figure 8 patterns with the drone and then land. Once on the ground let the drone sit for five minutes before stopping the data collection and powering off the unit. Congratulations! You collected your first LiDAR data! Retrieve Data for Processing \u00b6 All of the LiDAR, IMU, and GPS data is written to the usb stick which is attached to the R1a. When the unit is powered off you can detach the usb and insert into your PC to begin your processing.","title":"First Setup"},{"location":"quickstart/first-setup/#first-setup","text":"","title":"First Setup"},{"location":"quickstart/first-setup/#intro","text":"In this tutorial, we will walk you through the following steps: Attach the R1a to your vehicle Power on and connect to the R1a Configure the R1a Setup your base station Calibrate the R1a Collect data Retrieve data for processing To do this, you will need Rock R1a itself, a smartphone or PC, and the vehicle.","title":"Intro"},{"location":"quickstart/first-setup/#attach-the-r1a-to-your-vehicle","text":"The R1a can be attached to any number of vehicles in order to acquire LiDAR data.
